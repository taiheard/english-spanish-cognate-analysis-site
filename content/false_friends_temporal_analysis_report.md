# False Friends Temporal Analysis Report

**Generated:** November 03, 2025 at 08:33 UTC

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines **170 false friends** from the English-Spanish language corpus, tracking their emergence over time and changes in semantic shift patterns across three primary historical periods: Medieval (pre-1400), Renaissance (1500-1700), and Modern (1800-2000).

### Key Findings

- The **Medieval period** accounts for the largest share of false friends (55.3%)
- The **Renaissance period** shows substantial false friend emergence (31.8%)
- The **Modern period** exhibits reduced false friend formation (5.3%)
- These patterns support the hypothesis that semantic drift 'hot spots' occurred primarily in earlier periods

## Methodological Note: Transition Period

The **'Transition Period'** category (n=13, 7.6%) captures attestation dates that fall between the three primary analytical periods:

- **1400-1500** (Medieval-Renaissance gap): 6 entries (3.5%)
- **1700-1800** (Renaissance-Modern gap): 7 entries (4.1%)

These entries are analyzed separately to maintain the integrity of the three main historical classifications defined by the research framework. This methodological decision ensures that the analysis accurately reflects the temporal 'hot spots' as specified in the original periodization scheme, while transparently accounting for all data points in the corpus.

## Analysis 1: False Friend Emergence Profile by Historical Period

This analysis tests claims about temporal 'hot spots' for semantic drift by examining when false friends first appeared in English, grouped by historical period.

### Distribution by Period

| Historical Period | Count | Percentage |
|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Medieval (pre-1400) | 94 | 55.3% |
| Renaissance (1500-1700) | 54 | 31.8% |
| Modern (1800-2000) | 9 | 5.3% |
| Transition Period | 13 | 7.6% |
| Unknown | 0 | 0.0% |
| **Total** | **170** | **100.0%** |

## Analysis 2: Temporal Change in Risk Type

This analysis examines whether semantic shift types vary across historical periods, testing the hypothesis that modern false friends result primarily from technical specialization.

## Conclusions

1. **Temporal Hot Spots Confirmed:** The analysis validates the hypothesis that semantic drift 'hot spots' occurred primarily in earlier periods, with 55.3% emerging in the Medieval period.
2. **Declining False Friend Formation:** The dramatic decrease in the Modern period (5.3%) suggests fewer new false friends are emerging in contemporary times.
